# What Is Probabilistic Delivery? A New Operating System for Software Governance

*By Theo van Stratum, PhD*

---

Every year, organisations collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on software projects that arrive late, over budget, or simply fail to deliver. The post-mortems invariably describe the same sequence: dashboards showed green, stakeholders were reassured, and then — somewhere around month nine or eleven — reality arrived uninvited. What went wrong is rarely a question of effort or talent. It is almost always a question of measurement.

Probabilistic Delivery is a framework designed to solve that measurement problem. It applies the statistical rigour of actuarial science — the same discipline that underwrites insurance policies and manages financial risk portfolios — to the governance of software projects. The result is not a new flavour of methodology. It is a fundamentally different relationship between organisations and the uncertainty that is inherent to all complex technical work.
